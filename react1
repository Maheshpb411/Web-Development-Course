      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

Below is the index.js in react.js -->

import React from "react";
import Reactdom from "react-dom";

// instead of these two above lines we can also Write
// var react = require("react");
// var Reactdom = require("react-dom");

Reactdom.render(<h1>hello world</h1>,document.getElementById("root"));

// instead of above line we can write belo these three lines in js but which is very long as three lines


var h1 = document.createElement("h1");
h1.innerHTML = "hello World";
document.getElementById("root").appendChild(h1);

// buut instead writing these three lines we are getting a same op from single line in react...
// so this is the advantages of react.
