css position property ->

there are 4 types of position property
1.static -> is is a bydefault. when don't use any css in html the position present at that time is nothing but static.

2.relative -> relative: Positions the element relative to its normal positon and will leave a gap at its normal position.
              but it doesn't affect the another element present aside of it.
              if we write --
              p{
                position : relative;    --> it will doesn' affect any thing
                left : 20px;     -->now it will affect the css design.
              }

3.absolute -> 

4.fixed ->  Positions the element relative to the browser window.

5.sticky -> Positions the element relative to the users scroll position.

also we can centre the elements by making text-align : centre;
